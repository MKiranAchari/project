                    <p class="about">Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Early
                        diagnostics
                        significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is
                        tedious
                        and
                        often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer aided diagnosis systems showed
                        potential
                        for improving the diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly
                        reduce
                        the
                        chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. This application
                        is
                        based on Convolution Neural Networks which classifies the scan as either benign or malignant
                        tumor.</p>
